# Java Jar Decompilers
If you need to turn .class or .jar files into greppable source code then use either CFR or JDGui

## JDGui
 - http://java-decompiler.github.io/
 - decent and extremely popular but doesnt have CLI
 - just click and drag .jar into it and it will decompile

## CFR
 - http://www.benf.org/other/cfr/
 - has cli
 - use with: `java -jar ~/Downloads/cfr-0.141.jar lib/jjwt-0.6.0.jar`
